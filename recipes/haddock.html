    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Haddock (or other white fish) is lightly breaded and baked. Parmesan adds a nice flavor. Quick and easy to prepare, it's a nice alternative to deep frying.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> ¾ cup milk
            </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt
           </li>
        <li> ¾ cup bread crumbs
            ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
            ¼ teaspoon ground dried thyme
            4 haddock fillets
            ¼ cup butter, melted </li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry mushroom gravy mix</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol> <h3> <li>Step 1</li> </h3>

        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef stew meat, and cook until browned on the
        outside. Add the onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushroom gravy mix and 1 cup of
        water. Season with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Turn heat to low, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.

        <h3> <li>Step 2</li></h3>

        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer the beef mixture to a casserole dish. Roll out the
        puff pastry to cover the top of the casserole dish. Press edges onto the rim of the dish to seal. Whisk together
        the egg and 1 tablespoon of water in a small cup using a fork. Brush over the top of the pastry.

        <h3>  <li>Step 3</li></h3>

        Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.
    </ol>
